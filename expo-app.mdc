# Expo App Rules

## Storage
- Use `expo-secure-store` for sensitive data storage
- Do not use `AsyncStorage` or `react-native-encrypted-storage` for sensitive data
- Test storage operations with proper mocks in `__tests__/__mocks__/expo-secure-store.ts`

## Testing
- Mock external dependencies in `__tests__/__mocks__/`
- Clear mocks before each test
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in describe blocks

## Dependencies
- Use `npx expo install` for Expo packages
- Keep dependencies up to date with Expo SDK
- Check compatibility with `expo doctor`
